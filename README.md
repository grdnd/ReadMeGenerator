# Homework 09: Professional ReadMe Generator

<img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg'>

## Description

A good ReadMe is just as valuable in representing a project, as the project itself. Therefore, this generator was built with the project-oriented user in mind, and how they may best present their work. With the use of Node Inquirer and JavaScript, developers can easily populate a markdown page with their own project information, putting time and efficiency in the hands of the users.
